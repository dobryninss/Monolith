ent-BulkMiningRefinery = liquid metal refinery
    .desc = Separates ore from liquid metal and produces extremely toxic chlorine trifluoride. Connect an armored gas pipe just beyond the south edge of the body, two tiles from the center, and lead it to a mining exhaust injector. Gas overfilling causes a powerful explosion. Ordinary atmospheric pipes do not fit.
